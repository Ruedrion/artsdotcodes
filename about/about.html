             <section>  <p><b>arts.codes</b> is a platform focusing on multiple forms of art with computational and algorithmic underpinnings. It is a journal inclusive of the many digital/emerging media applications of today while also indexing historical works that are neither digital or electronic, but employ more traditional mediums or applications built with mathematical systems. arts.codes serves as a bimonthly digital journal and an annual printed publication presenting interviews with artists of all stripes, and reviews of exhibitions, performances and compositions. It is also a platform for open source distribution and creative sharing—where artists, designers and engineers share frameworks, techniques, code and methodologies with step-by-step explanatory articles.<br>

Clarke, arts.codes has a strong interest in community building and distributing artistic ideas and creations in today’s fluid media environment.
